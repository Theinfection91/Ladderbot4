## Configuring The Bot
How to set the Discord Token, Git PAT Token and HTTPS Url Path, and the Guild ID for SlashCommands:

## How To Generate a GitHub PAT Token

To use a GitHub repository as a backup storage system for the database `.json` files, you need to generate a **GitHub PAT Token** that targets the repository. Follow the instructions below:

---

### Step 1: Access Settings
On the GitHub Desktop site, navigate to your **Settings**.

![Step 1: Access Settings](examples/GitRepoSetup/1.png)

---

### Step 2: Open Developer Settings
In the left-hand menu, scroll down and select **Developer settings**.

![Step 2: Developer Settings](examples/GitRepoSetup/2.png)

---

### Step 3: Generate a New Fine-Grained Token
Click on **Fine-grained tokens** and then select **Generate new token**.

![Step 3: Generate Token](examples/GitRepoSetup/3.png)

---

### Step 4: Configure Token Details
1. **Name**: Enter a name for the token. This can be any descriptive name and is not used in the program.
2. **Expiration**: Choose an expiration date. It is recommended to set **"No expiration"** since the token will be used for long-term backups. This is optional and depends on your security needs.
3. **Repository Access**: Under **Repository Access**, select **Only select repositories** and choose the specific repository the token will target.

![Step 4: Configure Token Details](examples/GitRepoSetup/4.png)

---

### Step 5: Set Repository Permissions
Under **Repository Permissions**, locate **Contents** and set it to **Read and Write**. This will automatically enable **Metadata** as a required permission. You should now have **2 permissions** selected: **Contents** and **Metadata**.

![Step 5: Set Permissions](examples/GitRepoSetup/5.png)

---

### Step 6: Generate the Token
Click **Generate Token** to finalize the process.

![Step 6: Generate Token](examples/GitRepoSetup/6.png)

---

### Step 7: Save Your Token
Once the token is generated, **copy the token string** and store it securely. If you lose this token, you will need to regenerate it.

![Step 7: Save Token](examples/GitRepoSetup/7.png)

> **Note:** The generated token is required for the program to connect to GitHub and perform backup operations. It must be stored in your program‚Äôs configuration file securely.
